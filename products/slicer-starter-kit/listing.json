This kit gives you three ready-to-import Cura profiles for PLA, PETG, and TPU, plus a settings guide that explains the 10 most important settings in plain English.\n\nOptimized for the Ender 3 and Ender 3 V2, but the guide works with any FDM printer and any slicer. You'll also get a printable first-print checklist so you never forget a step.\n\nThese profiles were tested and tuned over dozens of prints. They're not default settings with a new name. Every value was chosen for a reason, and the guide explains why.\n\nThis kit is for people who want to spend less time tweaking and more time printing. Import the profiles, read the guide, and start getting better prints today.",
