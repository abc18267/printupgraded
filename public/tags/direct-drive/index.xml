      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;best-3d-printer-upgrades-that-actually-matter&#34;&gt;Best 3D Printer Upgrades That Actually Matter&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most lists of best 3D printer upgrades throw 20 items at you with no clear order. That&amp;rsquo;s not helpful. Some upgrades make a massive difference. Others are a waste of money. This guide ranks the upgrades that actually improve your prints, in the order you should install them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you own a budget printer like an Ender 3, CR-10, or Anycubic Kobra, these upgrades will get you closer to results you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a machine costing twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;direct-drive-vs-bowden-extruder-which-is-better-for-your-printer&#34;&gt;Direct Drive vs Bowden Extruder: Which Is Better for Your Printer?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re comparing direct drive vs Bowden, here&amp;rsquo;s the short answer. Bowden is better for speed. Direct drive is better for filament variety and print quality. If you want to print flexible filaments like TPU, direct drive is almost mandatory. If you only print PLA at high speeds, Bowden works great.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most budget printers come with Bowden setups. Many people upgrade to direct drive after hitting the limits of what Bowden can do. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
