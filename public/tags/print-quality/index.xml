      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;filament-drying-guide-why-it-matters-and-how-to-do-it-right&#34;&gt;Filament Drying Guide: Why It Matters and How to Do It Right&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wet filament is one of the most common causes of bad 3D prints. If your prints have rough surfaces, popping sounds, stringing, or weak layers, moisture is probably the problem. Filament drying is simple. You just need to apply gentle heat for a few hours. This guide covers why it matters, how to spot the signs, and the best ways to dry and store your filament.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Print Speed vs Quality: Finding the Right Balance</title>

Modern printers with input shaper and pressure advance can push 150-300 mm/s without losing much quality. The right speed depends on your printer, your material, and how much quality you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You need supports when your model has overhangs greater than 45 degrees from vertical. The best approach for most prints is tree or organic supports with 2-3 interface layers at 15% density. This gives you strong support that still removes cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
