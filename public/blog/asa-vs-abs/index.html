<h1 id="asa-vs-abs-which-filament-is-better-for-outdoor-prints">ASA vs ABS: Which Filament Is Better for Outdoor Prints?</h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;re comparing ASA vs ABS filament for outdoor prints, ASA wins. It&rsquo;s basically ABS with UV resistance built in. Parts printed in ASA hold up in direct sunlight for years without yellowing, cracking, or getting brittle. ABS degrades in UV light within months. For anything that lives outside, ASA is the right choice.</p>
<p>That said, ABS is cheaper and more widely available. If your parts stay indoors, ABS works fine and saves you a few bucks per spool. Let&rsquo;s break down the full comparison.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-asa-and-abs">What&rsquo;s the Difference Between ASA and ABS?</h2>
<p>Both are styrene-based plastics. They share a lot of the same properties. The difference comes down to one chemical change.</p>
<p>ABS stands for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. The butadiene component is what breaks down under UV light. When ABS sits in the sun, the butadiene degrades. The part yellows, becomes chalky on the surface, and eventually gets brittle and cracks.</p>
<p>ASA stands for Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate. It replaces the butadiene with an acrylate ester that doesn&rsquo;t break down in UV. That&rsquo;s the entire difference. Same strength. Same heat resistance. Same printability. Just better weather resistance.</p>
<p>Think of ASA as &ldquo;outdoor ABS.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="printing-asa-vs-abs-how-different-are-they">Printing ASA vs ABS: How Different Are They?</h2>
<p>If you can print ABS, you can print ASA. The settings are almost identical. ASA runs about 5-10C hotter at the nozzle, and some people report it warps slightly less than ABS. But the process is essentially the same.</p>
<p>Both filaments need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An enclosure.</strong> This isn&rsquo;t optional. ABS and ASA both warp aggressively in open air. Drafts are the enemy. Even a simple <a href="/blog/3d-printer-enclosure-guide/">enclosure</a> made from a plastic storage bin or foam board makes a huge difference.</li>
<li><strong>A heated bed at 90C+.</strong> Both need high bed temps for adhesion. PEI sheets work great. So does ABS slurry (dissolved ABS in acetone) or glue stick.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation.</strong> Both release fumes you don&rsquo;t want to breathe. ABS smells worse, but ASA isn&rsquo;t exactly pleasant either. Print in a ventilated room or use an enclosure with a carbon filter.</li>
<li><strong>Low to no cooling fan.</strong> These materials need to stay warm for good layer adhesion. 0-20% fan speed max.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="settings-for-both">Settings for Both</h3>
<p><strong>ASA starting settings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nozzle: 245-255C</li>
<li>Bed: 95-105C</li>
<li>Speed: 40-60mm/s</li>
<li>Fan: 0-15%</li>
<li>Retraction: 1-2mm (direct drive), 4-6mm (Bowden)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ABS starting settings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nozzle: 235-250C</li>
<li>Bed: 95-105C</li>
<li>Speed: 40-60mm/s</li>
<li>Fan: 0-15%</li>
<li>Retraction: 1-2mm (direct drive), 4-6mm (Bowden)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much difference. ASA just runs a little hotter.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-asa">When to Use ASA</h2>
<p>Choose ASA for anything that will spend time outdoors or near windows with direct sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>Good uses for ASA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Garden tools, plant markers, hose fittings</li>
<li>Car accessories (phone mounts, vent clips, emblems)</li>
<li>Outdoor electronics enclosures (weatherproof boxes, camera housings)</li>
<li>Signs, mailbox numbers, house numbers</li>
<li>Anything mounted outside that needs to look good for years</li>
</ul>
<p>ASA also has slightly better chemical resistance than ABS. If your part contacts oils, fuels, or cleaning chemicals, ASA is the safer pick.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-abs">When to Use ABS</h2>
<p>ABS makes sense for indoor functional parts where cost or color selection matters.</p>
<p><strong>Good uses for ABS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor functional parts (brackets, mounts, jigs)</li>
<li>Parts that need acetone smoothing for a glossy finish</li>
<li>Prototypes where you need heat resistance but not UV resistance</li>
<li>Large prints where filament cost adds up</li>
</ul>
<p>ABS has been around forever. You&rsquo;ll find way more color options, more brands, and lower prices. If the part stays indoors, there&rsquo;s no reason to pay extra for ASA&rsquo;s UV resistance.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-pla-or-petg-for-outdoor-use">What About PLA or PETG for Outdoor Use?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering if you even need ASA or ABS. Can&rsquo;t you just use something easier?</p>
<p><strong>PLA outdoors</strong> is a bad idea. It softens at 55-60C. A black PLA part in direct sunlight on a summer day can warp, sag, or deform completely. It also gets brittle over time with UV exposure.</p>
<p><strong>PETG outdoors</strong> is better than PLA. It handles UV better than ABS and has a higher heat resistance than PLA (around 75-80C). But it&rsquo;s not as tough as ASA and will still degrade over a few years in direct sun. For a full breakdown of these materials, check out our <a href="/blog/pla-vs-petg-vs-abs/">PLA vs PETG vs ABS comparison</a>.</p>
<p>For serious outdoor use, ASA is the best consumer filament option. Nothing else combines its UV resistance, heat resistance, and impact strength.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-warping-and-fumes">Dealing with Warping and Fumes</h2>
<p>The biggest headache with both ASA and ABS is warping. Large flat parts are the worst. Here&rsquo;s what helps.</p>
<p><strong>Reduce warping:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an enclosure. Always.</li>
<li>Increase bed temp to 100-110C for stubborn parts.</li>
<li>Use a brim (8-15mm) on large parts.</li>
<li>Apply ABS/ASA slurry to the bed (dissolve scraps in acetone).</li>
<li>Avoid sharp corners in your designs. Chamfers and fillets reduce stress.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open the enclosure during printing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Handle fumes safely:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never print ABS or ASA in a bedroom or small closed room without ventilation.</li>
<li>An enclosure with an activated carbon filter is the best setup.</li>
<li>At minimum, open a window or run a fan to move air out of the room.</li>
<li>If you notice headaches or irritation, improve your ventilation immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASA produces noticeably less odor than ABS. If fumes bother you, that&rsquo;s another point in ASA&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<h2 id="acetone-smoothing-both-work-great">Acetone Smoothing: Both Work Great</h2>
<p>One nice bonus of styrene-based filaments is acetone smoothing. You can place your finished print in a sealed container with a small amount of acetone vapor. The surface melts slightly and reforms smooth, hiding layer lines and giving a glossy finish.</p>
<p>Both ASA and ABS respond well to this process. The results look nearly injection-molded.</p>
<p>For <a href="/blog/reduce-stringing-slicer-settings/">stringing issues</a> that sometimes show up with these materials, tune your retraction settings before reaching for the acetone. It&rsquo;s better to fix the root cause.</p>
<h2 id="our-verdict">Our Verdict</h2>
<p>For outdoor parts, ASA is the clear winner. The UV resistance alone makes it worth the small price premium. It prints the same way, at similar settings, with similar difficulty. You&rsquo;re just getting a better material for a few extra dollars per spool.</p>
<p>For indoor parts, save your money and use ABS. You&rsquo;ll find more colors, lower prices, and the exact same performance where UV doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re printing both types of parts, keep a spool of each. Your settings barely change between them.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<details>
<summary>Can I print ASA without an enclosure?</summary>
<p>You can try, but you&rsquo;ll likely struggle with warping on anything bigger than a small part. Small items (under 50mm in any direction) might come out fine in a warm room with no drafts. Anything larger really needs an enclosure. Even a cheap DIY enclosure dramatically improves your success rate with ASA.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does ASA need to be dried before printing?</summary>
<p>ASA is moderately hygroscopic. It&rsquo;s not as bad as nylon, but a spool that&rsquo;s been sitting open for weeks will print noticeably worse. If you hear popping or see rough surfaces, dry it at 65-75C for 4-6 hours. For best results, store it in a sealed container with desiccant.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Is ASA safe to print at home?</summary>
<p>ASA releases styrene fumes during printing, similar to ABS. These aren&rsquo;t great to breathe in large amounts. Print in a well-ventilated area or use an enclosure with a carbon filter. Don&rsquo;t print in a closed bedroom. With proper ventilation, home printing is fine. The exposure levels during hobby printing are well below industrial limits, but there&rsquo;s no reason not to ventilate.</p>
