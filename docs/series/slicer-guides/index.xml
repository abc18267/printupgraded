These work as a reliable starting point for most printers. But the details matter, and small tweaks make the difference between an okay print and a great one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cura is the easiest to learn and supports the most printers. OrcaSlicer has the best auto-calibration tools and multi-color support. PrusaSlicer is the most stable and polished option. All three are free, and the right choice depends on your printer and experience level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Reduce Stringing in Your Slicer Settings</title>

These three settings fix stringing in about 90% of cases. The remaining 10% usually comes from wet filament, which is a hardware problem, not a slicer problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Infill Patterns Explained: Which One Should You Use?</title>

The right pattern depends on what you&amp;rsquo;re printing. Grid and lines work great for quick prints that don&amp;rsquo;t need strength. Gyroid is the best all-around choice for functional parts. Lightning saves the most material when you just need to support top layers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s become one of the most popular slicers in the 3D printing community thanks to its built-in calibration tools, fast slicing, and excellent multi-color support. This OrcaSlicer beginner guide will walk you through downloading, setting up, and making your first print.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Print Speed vs Quality: Finding the Right Balance</title>
      <link>https://abc18267.github.io/printupgraded/blog/print-speed-vs-quality/</link>

Modern printers with input shaper and pressure advance can push 150-300 mm/s without losing much quality. The right speed depends on your printer, your material, and how much quality you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Support Settings Guide: When and How to Use Supports</title>
      <link>https://abc18267.github.io/printupgraded/blog/3d-print-support-settings/</link>

You need supports when your model has overhangs greater than 45 degrees from vertical. The best approach for most prints is tree or organic supports with 2-3 interface layers at 15% density. This gives you strong support that still removes cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
