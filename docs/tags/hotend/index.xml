It lets you safely reach temperatures above 240C, which opens up PETG at proper settings, ABS, nylon, and other high-performance filaments. If you only print PLA and plan to keep it that way, you can skip this upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;best-3d-printer-upgrades-that-actually-matter&#34;&gt;Best 3D Printer Upgrades That Actually Matter&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most lists of best 3D printer upgrades throw 20 items at you with no clear order. That&amp;rsquo;s not helpful. Some upgrades make a massive difference. Others are a waste of money. This guide ranks the upgrades that actually improve your prints, in the order you should install them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you own a budget printer like an Ender 3, CR-10, or Anycubic Kobra, these upgrades will get you closer to results you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a machine costing twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
