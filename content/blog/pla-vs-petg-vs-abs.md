# PLA vs PETG vs ABS: Complete Filament Comparison Guide

If you're comparing PLA vs PETG vs ABS, here's the short answer. PLA is the easiest to print and best for beginners. PETG is stronger and more heat-resistant. ABS is the toughest but hardest to work with. The right choice depends on what you're printing and where it'll be used.

Let's break down exactly how these three filaments compare so you can pick the right one for your project.

## Quick Pick

- **Just getting started?** Go with PLA. It prints easily, looks great, and costs the least.
- **Need something functional?** PETG gives you strength and flexibility without the headaches of ABS.
- **Building parts that take abuse?** ABS is your best bet if you have an enclosure and good ventilation.

Now let's dig into each material.

## PLA: The Beginner's Best Friend

PLA (polylactic acid) is the most popular 3D printing filament for good reason. It's made from plant-based materials like corn starch. It prints at lower temperatures and rarely causes problems.

### Pros of PLA

- **Easiest filament to print.** Low warping, good bed adhesion, and forgiving settings make it perfect for beginners.
- **No enclosure needed.** You can print PLA on an open-frame printer with no issues.
- **Minimal fumes.** PLA smells slightly sweet when printing. No ventilation required, though it's always smart to have some airflow.
- **Great surface finish.** PLA produces sharp details and smooth surfaces. It's ideal for miniatures, cosplay props, and decorative items.
- **Cheapest option.** You'll find good PLA for $15-20 per kilogram. Check out our [best PLA filament brands](/blog/best-pla-filament/) for specific recommendations.
- **Huge color selection.** Every brand makes PLA in dozens of colors, including silks, mattes, and specialty blends.

### Cons of PLA

- **Low heat resistance.** PLA starts to soften around 60C (140F). A part left in a hot car will deform. Don't use it for anything near heat sources.
- **Brittle.** PLA snaps under impact rather than flexing. It's not great for parts that take repeated stress.
- **Poor outdoor durability.** UV light breaks down PLA over time. Outdoor prints will become chalky and weak within months.
- **Hard to post-process.** You can't vapor-smooth PLA like you can ABS. Sanding and painting are your main options.

### Best Uses for PLA

PLA shines for prototypes, display pieces, cosplay props, toys, and anything decorative. If the part won't see heat, stress, or weather, PLA is your go-to.

## PETG: The Practical Middle Ground

PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) sits right between PLA and ABS. It's stronger than PLA, easier than ABS, and handles heat and moisture well. Many experienced makers end up using PETG for most of their functional prints.

### Pros of PETG

- **Strong and somewhat flexible.** PETG bends before breaking, unlike PLA. This makes it better for functional parts that take stress.
- **Good heat resistance.** PETG handles temperatures up to about 80C. That's not as high as ABS, but it won't warp in a hot car.
- **Low warping.** PETG stays flat on the bed much better than ABS. You don't need an enclosure, though one can help.
- **Moisture and chemical resistant.** PETG doesn't absorb water easily. It holds up well against mild chemicals too. This makes it great for containers and outdoor parts.
- **Food-safe potential.** PETG itself is food-safe (it's what water bottles are made from). Keep in mind that the FDM printing process creates tiny gaps where bacteria can hide.
- **Minimal fumes.** Like PLA, PETG doesn't put off harmful fumes during printing.

### Cons of PETG

- **Stringing.** PETG is notorious for stringing. You'll need to dial in your retraction settings. Our [guide to printing PETG](/blog/how-to-print-petg/) covers how to fix this.
- **Sticks too well to some beds.** PETG can bond so strongly to glass beds that it rips chunks out. Use a PEI sheet or apply a release agent.
- **Slightly harder to print than PLA.** The higher temperatures and stringing tendency mean it takes more tuning.
- **Scratches easily.** PETG has a softer surface than ABS. It picks up scuffs and scratches over time.
- **Hygroscopic.** PETG absorbs moisture from the air if left out. You'll want to [dry your filament](/blog/filament-drying-guide/) and store it properly.

### Best Uses for PETG

PETG works great for functional parts, phone cases, tool holders, outdoor fixtures, storage containers, and mechanical components that don't need extreme heat resistance.

## ABS: The Tough Old-School Option

ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) has been around since the early days of 3D printing. It's the same plastic used in LEGO bricks. It's strong, heat-resistant, and can be vapor-smoothed for a glossy finish. But it's also the hardest of the three to print.

### Pros of ABS

- **Excellent heat resistance.** ABS handles temperatures up to about 100C. It won't deform in hot environments where PLA and PETG would fail.
- **Impact resistant.** ABS absorbs impacts well. It bends and flexes rather than cracking like PLA.
- **Vapor smoothing.** You can smooth ABS prints with acetone vapor. This gives a shiny, injection-molded look that's hard to achieve with other filaments.
- **Easy to post-process.** Beyond vapor smoothing, ABS sands, glues, and paints well.
- **Good for mechanical parts.** ABS is the classic choice for gears, enclosures, automotive parts, and anything that needs to be tough.

### Cons of ABS

- **Warping.** This is the big one. ABS shrinks as it cools, which causes corners to lift off the bed. An enclosure is basically required.
- **Harmful fumes.** ABS releases styrene when heated. You need proper ventilation. Don't print ABS in a bedroom or small office without an enclosure that vents outside.
- **Needs an enclosure.** Without stable ambient temperatures, ABS prints will crack, warp, and delaminate.
- **Higher bed temperature.** ABS needs a heated bed at 95-110C. Not all printers can reach this reliably.
- **UV degradation.** Surprisingly for a tough plastic, ABS breaks down in sunlight. It yellows and becomes brittle over time. For outdoor use, consider ASA instead.

### Best Uses for ABS

ABS is best for mechanical parts, automotive components, electrical enclosures, and anything that needs heat resistance or impact strength. It's also great when you want a smooth, finished look through vapor smoothing.

## How to Choose: A Decision Framework

Still not sure which to pick? Walk through these questions.

**Will the part be near heat (above 60C)?**
If yes, skip PLA. Choose PETG for moderate heat or ABS for high heat.

**Will it be used outdoors?**
PETG is your best bet. It handles UV and moisture better than PLA or ABS.

**Does it need to handle impacts or stress?**
Go with PETG or ABS. PLA will crack under repeated stress.

**Do you have an enclosure and ventilation?**
If no, don't bother with ABS. Use PETG for functional parts or PLA for decorative ones.

**Is this a prototype or display piece?**
PLA every time. It's cheap, looks great, and prints fast.

**Are you a beginner?**
Start with PLA. Move to PETG once you're comfortable. Try ABS when you're ready for a challenge and have the right setup.

## What About Other Filaments?

PLA, PETG, and ABS cover most use cases. But they aren't the only options.

**TPU** is a flexible filament that's great for phone cases, gaskets, and anything that needs to bend without breaking. It requires some printer modifications to print well. Check our [TPU printing guide](/blog/how-to-print-tpu/) for details.

**Nylon** is extremely tough and wear-resistant. It's great for gears, hinges, and functional prototypes. But it absorbs moisture like a sponge and needs careful [drying](/blog/filament-drying-guide/) before printing.

**ASA** is basically ABS with better UV resistance. If you need a tough outdoor part, ASA is the answer.

## Storage Matters for All Three

All filaments print better when they're dry. PETG and especially nylon are the worst offenders when it comes to absorbing moisture. But even PLA degrades after sitting out for weeks.

Wet filament causes popping, stringing, poor layer adhesion, and rough surfaces. Our [filament drying guide](/blog/filament-drying-guide/) covers everything you need to know about keeping your spools in top shape.

At minimum, store your filament in sealed bags or containers with desiccant. If you print regularly, a dedicated filament dryer is a worthwhile investment.
