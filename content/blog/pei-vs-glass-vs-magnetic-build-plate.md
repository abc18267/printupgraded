# PEI Build Plate vs Glass vs Magnetic: Which Print Surface Wins?

Comparing a PEI build plate vs glass? PEI wins for most people. It gives you strong adhesion when hot and easy part removal when cool. Glass is flatter and gives a smooth bottom finish, but parts can be hard to remove. Magnetic flex plates are convenient but wear out faster.

Your build surface affects every single print you make. Choosing the right one eliminates adhesion headaches and makes your workflow smoother. Let's compare the options.

## The Four Main Build Surface Types

### Textured PEI on Spring Steel

A spring steel sheet coated with a rough PEI surface. It sits on a magnetic sticker attached to your heated bed. This is the most popular upgrade surface right now.

**Pros:**
- Excellent adhesion for PLA, PETG, ABS, and most other filaments.
- Parts pop off when the bed cools. No scraping needed.
- The textured finish hides minor first-layer imperfections.
- Spring steel flexes, so you can bend parts off easily.
- Durable. Lasts months to years with proper care.

**Cons:**
- Bottom surface has a matte, textured finish (some people prefer smooth).
- Needs occasional cleaning with isopropyl alcohol to maintain adhesion.
- Cheap PEI sheets can have uneven coating that causes adhesion hot spots.

**Best for:** General purpose printing. If you could only have one surface, this is the one.

### Smooth PEI on Spring Steel

Same spring steel concept but with a smooth, shiny PEI coating instead of texture.

**Pros:**
- Gives parts a glossy, mirror-like bottom finish.
- Great adhesion with PLA.
- Easy part removal when cool.

**Cons:**
- PETG can bond too strongly and rip chunks off the PEI coating. You'll need a release agent like glue stick or Windex (yes, really) as a barrier layer.
- Shows scratches more easily than textured PEI.
- Adhesion can be uneven if the surface gets contaminated.

**Best for:** PLA prints where you want a clean, shiny bottom surface.

### Glass Bed

A flat piece of borosilicate glass or mirror glass, sometimes with a special coating like Creality's Carborundum.

**Pros:**
- Extremely flat. If your aluminum bed is warped, glass gives you a level surface.
- Smooth, glossy bottom finish on prints.
- Very durable. Glass doesn't wear out from normal use.
- Cheap. A piece of borosilicate glass costs $10-15.

**Cons:**
- Parts can be very hard to remove. You'll often need a scraper, which risks damaging the glass or the print.
- Usually needs adhesion aids (glue stick, hairspray, or painter's tape) for reliable sticking.
- Heavy. Adds mass to the bed, which can slow bed movements on bed-slinger printers.
- Glass can crack if you flex it or drop it (obviously).

**Best for:** People who need a dead-flat surface or want a perfectly smooth bottom finish and don't mind using adhesion aids.

### Basic Magnetic Flex Plates

These are the stock surfaces that come with many budget printers. A thin magnetic mat with a textured or smooth build surface.

**Pros:**
- Flexible. You can bend parts off the plate.
- Cheap to replace.
- Come pre-installed on most budget printers.

**Cons:**
- Wear out relatively fast. The surface loses adhesion after a few months of regular use.
- Adhesion isn't as reliable as PEI, especially at higher bed temps.
- Some warp over time from repeated heating and cooling.

**Best for:** PLA-only printing on a budget. Perfectly fine as a starter surface, but most people upgrade eventually.

## Which Surface Works Best for Each Filament?

Different filaments stick differently to each surface. Here's a quick reference. For detailed filament settings, check our [PLA vs PETG vs ABS comparison](/blog/pla-vs-petg-vs-abs/).

| Filament | Textured PEI | Smooth PEI | Glass | Magnetic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLA | Great | Great | Good (needs glue) | Good |
| PETG | Great | Risky (sticks too well) | Good (needs glue) | Fair |
| ABS | Great (with enclosure) | Good | Good (needs glue) | Poor |
| TPU | Good | Good | Fair | Fair |
| Nylon | Fair (needs glue) | Fair (needs glue) | Poor | Poor |

## Our Recommendation

Buy a textured PEI spring steel sheet as your primary surface. It's the single [best first upgrade](/blog/best-3d-printer-upgrades/) for any budget printer. Costs $15-30, installs in five minutes, and works with almost every filament.

If you also want glossy bottom surfaces on PLA prints, add a smooth PEI sheet as a secondary option. Having both lets you swap between them in seconds thanks to the magnetic mounting system.

Skip glass unless you specifically need a dead-flat reference surface or your heated bed is badly warped. The convenience of PEI makes glass feel outdated for most users.

**Top picks:**

- **Energetic spring steel PEI sheets** ($15-25). Excellent quality for the price. Available in textured and smooth versions for most bed sizes.
- **Creality PEI build plates** ($20-30). Good compatibility with Ender 3 and CR-10 series. Slightly thicker spring steel.
- **Prusa satin/textured sheets** ($30-40). Premium quality but only sized for Prusa printers. The gold standard if you have a Prusa.

## FAQ

**Why won't my prints stick to PEI?**

The most common cause is a dirty surface. Clean your PEI sheet with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol before every few prints. If that doesn't help, lightly scuff textured PEI with fine sandpaper (2000 grit) to refresh the surface. Also check that your first layer height and bed temperature are set correctly.

**Can I use PEI for PETG?**

Yes, but use textured PEI. PETG bonds too aggressively to smooth PEI and can damage the coating. On textured PEI, PETG sticks well during printing and releases cleanly when cool. If you must use smooth PEI with PETG, apply a thin layer of glue stick as a release agent.

**How long does a PEI sheet last?**

With proper care, a quality PEI sheet lasts 6-12 months of regular printing. Clean it with isopropyl alcohol, avoid scratching it with metal tools, and don't overheat it. Some users report their sheets lasting over a year.

**Is glass or PEI more flat?**

Glass is usually flatter. If your aluminum heated bed has significant warps, glass provides a more level surface. However, most modern printers with mesh bed leveling can compensate for minor bed imperfections, making PEI's adhesion advantages more important than glass's flatness.
