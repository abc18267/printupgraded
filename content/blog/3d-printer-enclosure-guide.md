# 3D Printer Enclosure: Do You Need One?

You need a 3D printer enclosure if you print ABS, ASA, nylon, or polycarbonate. These filaments warp badly when they cool unevenly. An enclosure traps heat around your printer and keeps the temperature stable. If you only print PLA or PETG, you don't need one.

That said, enclosures offer benefits beyond just warping prevention. Let's cover when you actually need one, what your options are, and the safety stuff you can't ignore.

## What an Enclosure Actually Does

A 3D printer enclosure is just a box around your printer. It can be fancy or it can be a cardboard box (though please don't use cardboard for safety reasons).

Here's what that box does:

**Keeps ambient temperature stable.** This is the main purpose. When you print [ABS or ASA](/blog/pla-vs-petg-vs-abs/), the filament needs to cool slowly and evenly. A draft from an open window or air conditioning vent can cause one side of your print to cool faster than the other. That temperature difference creates internal stress, which causes warping, cracking, and layer splitting.

**Reduces noise.** The walls of an enclosure dampen motor noise, fan noise, and vibration. If your printer lives in a shared space, this is a nice bonus.

**Contains fumes.** ABS and ASA produce styrene fumes during printing. An enclosure contains these fumes so you can vent them outside through a duct or filter, rather than breathing them in all day.

**Keeps dust out.** Dust on your print bed ruins first-layer adhesion. Dust on your filament can clog your nozzle. An enclosed printer stays cleaner.

**Protects against curious hands and paws.** If you have kids or pets, an enclosure keeps them away from the hot nozzle and moving parts.

## When You Don't Need an Enclosure

**PLA printing.** PLA actually prefers cool air. It prints best with good part cooling and lower ambient temperatures. An enclosure can make PLA prints worse by trapping heat and causing poor overhangs and droopy bridges.

**PETG printing.** PETG is much more forgiving than ABS. It warps very little and doesn't need an enclosed environment. You can print PETG in the open without issues.

**If your room is draft-free and warm.** Some people print ABS successfully without an enclosure in a small, warm room with no air currents. It's possible but less reliable.

## DIY Enclosure Options

### The IKEA Lack Enclosure

This is the most popular DIY enclosure in the 3D printing community, and for good reason. You stack two IKEA Lack side tables ($10 each) on top of each other. The printer sits on the bottom table. The top table becomes the roof. You add acrylic or plexiglass panels on the sides and a door on the front.

**Cost:** $30-60 total (tables, acrylic panels, hinges, and hardware).

**Pros:** Cheap, proven design, tons of community guides and printable accessories. Fits most Ender 3 and similar-sized printers.

**Cons:** Looks somewhat DIY. The Lack tables aren't very sturdy, so you may want to reinforce the legs. Not great for larger printers.

### Cardboard Box (Temporary Only)

Some people use a large cardboard box as a quick test. This is fine for a one-time experiment to see if an enclosure helps your ABS prints. But don't use cardboard as a permanent solution. It's a fire risk near heated components.

### Custom-Built Enclosure

If you're handy, you can build an enclosure from plywood, acrylic, or aluminum extrusions. This gives you complete control over size, ventilation, and features.

**Cost:** $50-150 depending on materials.

**Pros:** Custom-sized for your printer. Can include built-in ventilation, lighting, and filament storage.

**Cons:** Takes time and tools to build.

## Pre-Made Enclosure Options

If DIY isn't your thing, several companies sell ready-made enclosures.

**Creality enclosure** ($50-70). A fabric and frame enclosure that folds flat for storage. It's not airtight and won't hold heat as well as rigid panels, but it's a big step up from nothing. Easy to set up and take down.

**Sovol enclosure** ($60-80). Similar concept to the Creality option. Fabric panels on an aluminum frame. Good for moderate heat retention.

**Custom acrylic enclosures.** Some makers on Etsy sell laser-cut acrylic enclosure kits for specific printers. These look clean and work well but cost $100-200+.

Pre-made enclosures are convenient but rarely perform as well as a properly sealed DIY build. The fabric-based ones especially let heat escape through the seams. They're good for reducing drafts and containing fumes, but they won't hold chamber temps as high as rigid panels.

## Safety: The Part You Can't Skip

**Ventilation is not optional for ABS and ASA.** These filaments produce fumes that you shouldn't breathe. Your enclosure needs a way to vent fumes outside. A small inline fan (like a 4-inch duct fan) connected to a hose running to a window works well. You can also use an activated carbon filter, but replace it regularly because they lose effectiveness over time.

**Fire safety matters.** Your printer has a heated bed (100C+) and a hotend (200C+) running for hours at a time. Make sure your enclosure materials won't melt or catch fire if something goes wrong. Acrylic and polycarbonate panels are good choices. Keep the enclosure away from flammable materials.

**Don't enclose your electronics.** Your printer's mainboard and power supply generate heat. If possible, mount them outside the enclosure or make sure they have adequate airflow. Overheating electronics can cause thermal shutdowns or, worse, failures.

**Monitor your prints.** Use a camera inside the enclosure so you can check on long prints without opening the door and letting heat escape.

## Enclosure and Filament Storage: A Two-Part System

An enclosure helps with print quality, but it doesn't solve filament moisture problems. Nylon and PETG absorb moisture from the air, and a warm enclosure doesn't dry your filament.

You still need proper [filament drying and storage](/blog/filament-drying-guide/) as a separate step. Some people mount a filament dryer on top of their enclosure and feed dry filament directly into the printer. That's an excellent setup if you print moisture-sensitive materials regularly.

## Our Recommendation

If you print ABS, ASA, or nylon regularly, build or buy an enclosure. The IKEA Lack enclosure is hard to beat for the price. Add a ventilation fan and you're set.

If you only print PLA and PETG, spend your money on other upgrades first. A [PEI build plate](/blog/pei-vs-glass-vs-magnetic-build-plate/) or [all-metal hotend](/blog/all-metal-hotend-upgrade/) will improve your prints more than an enclosure will.

## FAQ

**What temperature should a 3D printer enclosure reach?**

For ABS, aim for a chamber temperature of 40-60C. You don't need a separate heater in most cases. The heated bed alone (set to 100-110C) will warm the enclosure to 40-50C within 15-20 minutes. Higher chamber temps (60C+) help with nylon and polycarbonate but can damage printer components that aren't rated for that heat.

**Can I use an enclosure for PLA?**

You can, but it often hurts PLA quality. PLA needs good part cooling to handle overhangs and bridges. A warm enclosure works against this. If you must use an enclosure with PLA, open the door or remove a panel to let cool air in.

**Is the IKEA Lack enclosure big enough for an Ender 3?**

Yes. The Lack table top is 55x55cm, which fits the Ender 3, Ender 3 V2, and Ender 3 S1 with room to spare. It's tight for larger printers like the CR-10 or Ender 5 Plus. Measure your printer's footprint (including the Y-axis travel) before you commit.

**Do I need a heated enclosure or is passive heat enough?**

Passive heat from the heated bed is enough for ABS and ASA. The bed puts out a surprising amount of heat in an enclosed space. Active heated enclosures are only necessary for polycarbonate and some nylons that need chamber temps above 60C.
