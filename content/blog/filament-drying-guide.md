# Filament Drying Guide: Why It Matters and How to Do It Right

Wet filament is one of the most common causes of bad 3D prints. If your prints have rough surfaces, popping sounds, stringing, or weak layers, moisture is probably the problem. Filament drying is simple. You just need to apply gentle heat for a few hours. This guide covers why it matters, how to spot the signs, and the best ways to dry and store your filament.

## Why Moisture Ruins Your Prints

Most 3D printing filaments are hygroscopic. That means they absorb water from the air. Even if you can't see or feel the moisture, it's there.

When wet filament hits the hot nozzle, the water inside turns to steam. That steam creates tiny bubbles in the melted plastic. These bubbles cause several visible problems.

**Popping and hissing.** You'll hear small pops or crackles as water vaporizes inside the nozzle. This is the easiest way to spot wet filament.

**Rough, pitted surfaces.** Steam bursting through the outer layer of extruded filament creates tiny craters and an uneven texture.

**Excessive stringing.** Moisture makes filament more prone to stringing and oozing between travel moves.

**Poor layer adhesion.** Steam pockets between layers create weak bonds. Parts break apart more easily along layer lines.

**Inconsistent extrusion.** Steam disrupts the steady flow of plastic, causing blobs, under-extrusion, and uneven line widths.

Some materials absorb moisture faster than others. Here's a rough ranking from worst to least problematic.

| Material | Moisture Sensitivity | Drying Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Nylon | Extremely high | Must dry before every use |
| TPU | High | Dry before printing |
| PETG | Moderate-High | Dry if stored open |
| ABS | Moderate | Dry if showing symptoms |
| PLA | Low-Moderate | Dry if stored open for weeks |
| ASA | Moderate | Dry if showing symptoms |

Even PLA, which is the least problematic, will print noticeably worse after sitting unsealed for a few weeks in a humid environment.

If you're working with PETG, our [PETG printing guide](/blog/how-to-print-petg/) covers moisture-related issues specific to that material.

## How to Tell if Your Filament Is Wet

You don't need a moisture meter. Just watch and listen while you print.

**Listen for popping.** Load the filament and extrude some plastic by hand or with a purge line. If you hear popping, crackling, or hissing, it's wet. Dry filament extrudes quietly.

**Look at the extruded line.** Dry filament produces a smooth, consistent strand. Wet filament produces a rough, bubbly strand with an uneven surface.

**Check the print surface.** If your prints have tiny pits, rough patches, or a matte look where they should be smooth, moisture is likely the cause.

**Notice stringing changes.** If a filament that used to print cleanly now strings like crazy, it's probably absorbed moisture since you last used it.

## Filament Drying Methods

You have three main options for drying filament. Each works, but they differ in convenience and precision.

### Dedicated Filament Dryer

A purpose-built dryer is the easiest and safest option. Models like the Sunlu FilaDryer S2, eSUN eBox, and EIBOS Cyclopes hold one or two spools and maintain a precise temperature.

**How to use it:** Set the temperature for your filament type, load the spool, and wait 4-8 hours. Most dryers let you print directly from the dryer, which keeps the filament dry during long prints.

**Pros:**
- Set it and forget it
- Precise temperature control
- Some models let you feed filament directly to the printer
- Safe and designed for the task

**Cons:**
- Costs $30-70 for a decent unit
- Only holds 1-2 spools at a time
- Cheap models may not reach advertised temperatures

### Food Dehydrator

A food dehydrator with adjustable temperature settings works great for drying filament. Look for one with a temperature dial (not just preset buttons) that goes up to at least 70C.

**How to use it:** Remove some trays to make room for the spool. Set the temperature based on the filament type. Run for 4-8 hours.

**Pros:**
- Affordable ($30-50)
- Holds multiple spools if the trays are large enough
- Reliable and widely available
- Good airflow helps dry faster

**Cons:**
- Your kitchen will smell like warm plastic
- May not reach high enough temperatures for nylon
- Not designed for filament, so fit can be awkward
- Your family may have opinions about you drying plastic in the food appliance

### Oven (Use with Caution)

Your kitchen oven can dry filament, but it's the riskiest option. Most oven thermostats aren't accurate, and if the temperature spikes too high, you'll melt your filament into a solid brick.

**How to use it:** Set the oven to the lowest temperature. Use an oven thermometer (not the oven's display) to verify the actual temperature. Place the spool on a baking sheet. Crack the door to let moisture escape. Check every 30 minutes.

**Pros:**
- You already own one
- No extra cost
- Can do multiple spools at once

**Cons:**
- Oven temperature accuracy is poor at low settings
- Easy to melt filament if temperature spikes
- Requires babysitting
- Some ovens can't go low enough

**We don't recommend the oven method** unless you've verified your oven's accuracy with a standalone thermometer. A ruined spool costs more than a filament dryer.

## Recommended Drying Temperatures and Times

| Material | Temperature | Time |
|---|---|---|
| PLA | 45-50C | 4-6 hours |
| PETG | 60-65C | 4-6 hours |
| ABS | 60-65C | 4-6 hours |
| TPU | 50-55C | 4-6 hours |
| Nylon | 70-80C | 6-12 hours |
| ASA | 60-65C | 4-6 hours |

**Important:** Don't exceed these temperatures. PLA starts to soften around 60C. If you dry PLA at 65C, the spool may warp and the filament can fuse together. Always stay below the material's glass transition temperature.

## How to Store Filament Properly

Drying fixes the problem. Good storage prevents it from coming back.

**Vacuum-sealed bags.** Resealable vacuum bags with desiccant packets are the simplest storage solution. Squeeze out the air, seal it up, and toss in a few silica gel packets. This works great for spools you don't use often.

**Airtight containers.** Plastic storage bins with tight-fitting lids hold multiple spools. Add rechargeable desiccant packets and a small hygrometer to monitor humidity levels. Aim for below 20% relative humidity inside the container.

**Dry boxes with feed holes.** If you want to print from a sealed environment, you can build or buy a dry box with PTFE tube fittings. The filament feeds out through a small hole directly to the printer while staying sealed with desiccant.

**Rechargeable desiccant.** Silica gel desiccant packets can be dried out in the oven (at 120C for a couple hours) and reused many times. The color-indicating type turns from orange to green when saturated, so you know when to recharge them.

### How long does it take to dry filament?

Most filaments need 4-6 hours of drying at the right temperature. Nylon needs 6-12 hours because it absorbs more moisture. Very wet filament may need a second drying cycle.

### Can you over-dry filament?

Not really, as long as the temperature stays correct. Leaving filament in a dryer longer than needed won't hurt it. The risk is temperature, not time. Too much heat will soften or fuse the filament.

### Does PLA need to be dried?

PLA absorbs less moisture than other filaments, but it still benefits from drying if it's been stored unsealed for more than a few weeks. If you hear popping during printing or see rough surfaces, drying your PLA at 45-50C for 4-6 hours will help.

### Can I dry filament in a microwave?

No. Microwaves heat unevenly and can melt or deform your filament in seconds. They heat the plastic itself rather than just evaporating the moisture. Use a dedicated dryer, food dehydrator, or carefully monitored oven instead.
