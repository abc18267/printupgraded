# Best PLA Filament Brands: Top Picks for Reliable Prints

The best PLA filament brands give you consistent diameter, accurate colors, and clean prints without constant troubleshooting. After testing dozens of spools across multiple printers, these five brands deliver the most reliable results. If you just want one answer, Overture PLA is our top pick for the best balance of quality and price.

## Quick Picks

- **Best Overall:** Overture PLA
- **Best Premium:** Polymaker PolyTerra PLA
- **Best Budget:** eSUN PLA+
- **Most Popular:** Hatchbox PLA
- **Best Value Multi-Pack:** Sunlu PLA

## 1. Overture PLA: Best Overall

**Price:** ~$17-19 per kg

Overture consistently produces some of the best PLA filament at a price that won't hurt your wallet. Their dimensional accuracy is excellent, typically within +/- 0.02mm. You get consistent extrusion with minimal stringing.

Every spool comes vacuum-sealed with desiccant. That's a small touch, but it means the filament arrives dry and ready to print. The spool also has a built-in filament holder design that works well on most setups.

**Pros:**
- Tight diameter tolerance (+/- 0.02mm)
- Reliable bed adhesion without glue or tape
- Good color accuracy across batches
- Affordable price point
- Well-packaged with desiccant

**Cons:**
- Color selection is more limited than Hatchbox or Polymaker
- Matte finish options are slim
- Occasionally tight spool winding can cause tangles if you're not careful

**Best for:** Everyday printing where you want consistent results without spending a lot.

## 2. Polymaker PolyTerra PLA: Best Premium

**Price:** ~$20-24 per kg

Polymaker's PolyTerra line stands out for its beautiful matte finish and eco-friendly packaging. The prints have a soft, smooth texture that looks more professional than standard shiny PLA. They also include a cardboard spool to reduce plastic waste.

PolyTerra prints at slightly lower temperatures than standard PLA (190-210C works well). The layer adhesion is excellent and the filament flows smoothly with minimal adjustments.

**Pros:**
- Gorgeous matte finish that hides layer lines
- Huge color palette including pastels and earth tones
- Eco-friendly cardboard spool and packaging
- Excellent dimensional accuracy
- Great layer adhesion at lower temperatures

**Cons:**
- Costs more than budget options
- Matte finish means you can't get a glossy look without post-processing
- Cardboard spool can absorb moisture if left unsealed
- Not as strong as PLA+ formulations

**Best for:** Display models, gifts, and prints where appearance matters most.

## 3. eSUN PLA+: Best Budget

**Price:** ~$14-18 per kg

eSUN's PLA+ is technically a modified PLA that's tougher and more heat-resistant than standard PLA. At its price point, it's hard to beat. You get better impact resistance and slightly higher temperature tolerance while still getting the ease of printing that makes PLA great.

It prints a few degrees hotter than regular PLA (205-225C is the sweet spot). The finish is glossy and the color accuracy is good, though not as precise as Polymaker or Overture.

**Pros:**
- Incredibly affordable
- Stronger and less brittle than standard PLA
- Better heat resistance than regular PLA
- Prints cleanly with minimal stringing
- Wide availability on Amazon and other retailers

**Cons:**
- Diameter consistency isn't as tight as premium brands
- Colors can vary slightly between batches
- Spool quality is just okay
- Needs slightly higher temps than standard PLA

**Best for:** Functional parts where you want PLA-level ease with better durability, and you're watching your budget.

## 4. Hatchbox PLA: Most Popular

**Price:** ~$22-26 per kg

Hatchbox was one of the first popular filament brands, and it's still a solid choice. Their PLA has good dimensional accuracy, a massive color selection, and a reputation built over years of consistent quality.

The downside is the price. Hatchbox has gotten more expensive over time, and you can get comparable quality from Overture or eSUN for less. But if you've been using Hatchbox and it works for you, there's no compelling reason to switch.

**Pros:**
- Huge color selection (one of the largest)
- Long track record of consistent quality
- Good dimensional accuracy (+/- 0.03mm)
- Widely available and well-reviewed
- Excellent bed adhesion

**Cons:**
- More expensive than comparable brands
- Price has increased significantly over the years
- Packaging is basic compared to Overture or Polymaker
- No PLA+ option for improved strength

**Best for:** Makers who value a proven track record and wide color options and don't mind paying a premium.

## 5. Sunlu PLA: Best Value Multi-Pack

**Price:** ~$12-16 per kg (lower in multi-packs)

Sunlu offers the most affordable PLA that's still reliably printable. Their multi-packs are especially good deals if you're going through a lot of filament. You won't get the tightest tolerances, but for prototyping, test prints, and high-volume work, Sunlu delivers solid results.

The quality has improved a lot in recent years. Earlier batches had diameter inconsistencies, but recent spools have been noticeably better.

**Pros:**
- Lowest price per kg, especially in multi-packs
- Quality has improved significantly recently
- Decent color selection
- Good for high-volume printing and prototyping
- Readily available

**Cons:**
- Diameter tolerance isn't as tight as premium options
- Occasional spool tangles
- Color accuracy can vary between batches
- Surface finish isn't as smooth as Polymaker or Overture
- Customer service can be slow

**Best for:** Budget printing, prototyping, education settings, and anyone who goes through a lot of filament.

## What to Look for in PLA Filament

Not all PLA is created equal. Here's what separates good filament from bad.

**Diameter consistency.** The filament should be 1.75mm (+/- 0.03mm or better) across the entire spool. Inconsistent diameter causes under-extrusion and over-extrusion.

**Moisture content.** Filament should arrive vacuum-sealed with desiccant. Even PLA prints worse when it's absorbed moisture. If your filament pops or sizzles during printing, it's wet. Our [filament drying guide](/blog/filament-drying-guide/) can help.

**Spool quality.** A well-wound spool feeds smoothly. Cheap spools with crossed windings cause tangles and failed prints.

**Color consistency.** Good brands maintain the same color across production batches. Budget brands may vary.
