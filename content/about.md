We're 3D printing hobbyists. Just like you.

We've spent way too many hours chasing down stringing problems, testing filament brands, and swapping out hotends at midnight. We've made the mistakes so you don't have to.

## What We Do

PrintUpgraded is a resource for people who already own a 3D printer and want better results. We don't cover the basics of "what is 3D printing." You're past that.

Instead, we focus on the stuff that actually moves the needle:

- **Upgrades that matter.** Not every mod is worth your time. We test upgrades on real printers and tell you which ones make a real difference.
- **Filament comparisons.** We print the same test models with different brands and share the results. No guessing.
- **Slicer settings.** Small changes in your slicer can fix big problems. We break down the settings that matter most.
- **Troubleshooting.** When something goes wrong (and it will), we help you figure out why and how to fix it.

## How We Test

We don't just read spec sheets and rewrite them. We run upgrades on our own printers. We print with the filament. We tweak the settings.

When we recommend something, it's because we've used it. When we say something isn't worth the money, that's from experience too.

## Our Printers

We test on popular machines from Creality, Anycubic, and others. These are the printers most hobbyists actually own. If you're running an Ender 3, a Kobra, or something similar, our guides are written for you.

## Affiliate Links

Some links on this site are affiliate links. That means we earn a small commission if you buy something through them. It doesn't cost you anything extra.

This doesn't change what we recommend. We only link to products we've actually tested or would use ourselves. You can read our full [affiliate disclosure](/affiliate-disclosure/) for more details.
