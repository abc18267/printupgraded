Here's the deal. Running a website costs money. We pay for hosting, test equipment, filament, and all the upgrades we review. Affiliate links help us cover those costs.

## What Are Affiliate Links?

Some links on PrintUpgraded point to products on sites like Amazon, Overture 3D, Anycubic, Creality, and MatterHackers. When you click one of these links and buy something, we earn a small commission. It doesn't cost you a single penny more.

## Does This Affect Our Recommendations?

No. We recommend products based on our own testing and experience. If something isn't good, we won't recommend it just because it pays a higher commission. That would be a waste of your time and money. And it would make this site useless.

We've turned down affiliate partnerships with products we didn't believe in. We'll keep doing that.

## How to Spot Affiliate Links

We try to be clear about it. You'll often see a note at the top of articles that include affiliate links. The note looks something like this:

> **Disclosure:** This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase through these links, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.

## The Bottom Line

We started PrintUpgraded because we love 3D printing and wanted to help other hobbyists get better results. Affiliate commissions help keep the site running, but they'll never drive what we write or recommend.

If you have questions about any of this, feel free to reach out. We're happy to be transparent about how we keep the lights on.
